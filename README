Goals:
--------------------
1. Make sure everyone can clone and push to the repo!!!!!

Decide what our game is going to be about - it does NOT have to be about a car, that was just my basic idea
Decide how the game will work
Decide each persons role in the project
Create a Main Menu, this should be simple, but can be done at anytime
