Notes:
--------------------
Remember to add things to the credit if you use something from online. 
Remember it's okay to ask for help. 
Remember this doesn't have to be super complicated. 
Remember to write down what you did in each build, even the simple things. 

Goals:
--------------------
1. Make sure everyone can clone and push to the repo!!!!!

Decide what our game is going to be about - it does NOT have to be about a car, that was just my basic idea
Decide how the game will work
Decide each persons role in the project
Create a Main Menu, this should be simple, but can be done at anytime
